## 🧾 What You’ll Find in This Portfolio

This repository is organized as a comprehensive, production-ready **fraud detection system** with a clear folder structure and modular components. Also in this repository is the directory **other_project/** which documents and highlights some other projects done in diffenent.

## 💡 Project Focus: Fraud Detection System

This project builds an end-to-end fraud detection application with the following highlights:

- **Machine Learning Models**: Experimentation with Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree and Deep Neural Networks.
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: Selected for optimal trade-off between interpretability and performance.
- **Preprocessing & Security**: SHA-256 masking of sensitive fields for PII protection.
- **CLI Application**: Command-line interface for running the pipeline on CSV or SQLite inputs.
- **Database Integration**: SQLite support for enterprise-ready storage and output.
- **Robust Testing**: Unit tests and end-to-end validation using `pytest`.
